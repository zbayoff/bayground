# The Bayground

The Bayground is a collection of mini apps and games written in Vanilla JavaScript using features from the latest ECMAScript 2015 specification.

The purpose of this site was to practice and become accostomed to writing and implementing these modern JavaScript features.
Such features include the awesome Higher Order Functions like map, filter, and reduce, fat arrow functions, the new 'Class' syntax, const and let for variable declarations, 'use strict' mode, and much more.  

Of course, not all browsers currently support these ES2015+ features, and must be transpiled into pre-ES2015 code. I used Webpack with Babel to perform this compilation and well as to bundel and compress my code.

This project is ongoing, and I will continue to add new modules and games whenever an idea strikes.
